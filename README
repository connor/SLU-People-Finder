No reason why you would want to, but you can download the extension here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nhbckkffdegfdfgffjkibmhddijbmkii

This is a simple Chrome Extension for mostly personal use. Really nothing too exciting going on in the code, but it does solve a personal problem I was having. The button is using the CSS3 Buttons library, found here: http://css3buttons.michaelhenriksen.dk/.
